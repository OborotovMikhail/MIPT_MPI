## Main task

With the help of pthread, it is necessary to make a program that will calculate a definite integral of sin(1/x) function in the limit from a certain positive real number to some larger positive real number. It is necessary to balance the solution - the task execution time on all threads should be the same. So, the integration steps must be dynamic.
